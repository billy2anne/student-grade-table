# User can view all grades.

## Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch from your `master` branch. Your branch should be named `view-all-grades` because that is the feature you are implementing.

## üí∞ Motivation

The IT department at a school has set up a database and server for managing student grades. Teachers at the school need a user-friendly way to view these grades.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄ Implementation

**Make a commit after completing each of the following steps**. Your commit message should be a summary description of the code you wrote an why. For this feature, you will make about 15-20 commits.

#### Initial HTML

1. Did you remember to check out a new branch?
1. Since this is the first feature of the application, create a new `index.html`.
1. Link the `bootstrap.css` library to your HTML file. You can get the `<link>` tag [from cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/twitter-bootstrap). **Be sure to use Bootstrap version 4**. You don't need the Bootstrap JavaScript library, just the CSS.
1. Add a header element to your `index.html` that contains the page title (Student Grade Table).
1. Add a table to `index.html` that looks like the example wireframe and [style it with Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/content/tables/). Hard-code three rows in your HTML table for the moment.
1. At this point, your HTML page should look like the wire frame.

#### Initial JavaScript Files

1. Add the jQuery library via a script tag to the **bottom** of the body in your `index.html`. You can get the `<script>` tag [from cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery). Use the `jquery.js` library rather than `core` or `slim`.
1. Create a new JavaScript file named `main.js` and add a script tag to the **bottom** of the body in your `index.html`, below the jQuery script tag.
1. Make a new directory named `components`. This will hold your various JavaScript components that control the DOM. Make a new JavaScript file at `components/app.js`. This will contain the primary component for your Student Grade Table application. Add a script tag for `components/app.js` just before your `main.js` script tag in `index.html`.
1. Verify that your JavaScript files are loading correctly by checking the **Network** tab of your browser's dev tools while refreshing the page.
1. Did you remember to commit every step?

#### Requesting Data

1. Within `components/app.js`, define a JavaScript class named `App`. This will be the primary class of your Student Grade Table application.
1. Define the following methods in your `App` class:
    - `handleGetGradesError` takes one parameter, `error`, and passes it to the [`error` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/error) of the `console` object.
    - `handleGetGradesSuccess` takes one parameter, `grades`, and passes it to the [`log` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log) of the `console` object.
    - `constructor` takes no parameters for the moment, but should [`bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) both `handleGetGradesError` and `handleGetGradesSuccess` to the `this` object.
    - `getGrades` takes no parameters, but in its code block, calls [jQuery's `ajax` method](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jQuery-ajax-settings) to send a `GET` request to [the Student Grade Table API](https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/sgt_api#get-all-grades) to retrieve a list of grades. The `handleGetGradesError` and `handleGetGradesSuccess` methods should be used as the `error` and `success` callbacks in the ajax config object.
    - `start` takes no parameters, but in its code block calls the `getGrades` method of the `this` object.
1. In `main.js`, instantiate your `App` class and call the `start` method of the resulting object. Watch the **Console** and **Network** tabs of your browser's developer tools. You should see a request for the data in the **Network** tab and the received array of data in the **Console** tab.

#### Rendering the Grades

1. Delete the hard-coded table rows from your `index.html`, but leave the column headers so that it just looks like an empty table.
1. Create a new JavaScript file at `components/grade-table.js` and add a corresponding script tag to your `index.html` just before the script tag for `main.js`. Verify that your file is loading properly by looking at the **Network** tab of your browser's developer tools.
1. Within `components/grade-table.js`, define a class named `GradeTable` with the following methods:
    - `constructor` takes one parameter, `tableElement` and assigns it to the a property of the `this` object.
    - `updateGrades` takes one parameter, `grades` and logs it to the console for the time being.
1. Within `components/app.js`, add a `gradeTable` parameter to the `constructor`. The code block should assign `gradeTable` to a property of the `this` object.
1. Within `components/app.js`, modify the `handleGetGradesSuccess` method definition to pass its `grades` parameter to the `updateGrades()` method of the `gradeTable` property of the `this` object (instead of logging `grades` to the console).
    ```js
    this.gradeTable.updateGrades(grades)
    ```
1. Within `main.js` make the following modifications:
    - Before `App` is instantiated, query the document for your table element.
    - After you get the table element, but before instantiating `App`, instantiate `GradeTable`, passing in the table element.
    - Modify your instantiation of `App` to pass in your `GradeTable` instance as an argument.
1. Verify that your application still requests and logs the grade data without any errors before moving on.
1. Review the following DOM methods:
    - [`document.createElement()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement)
    - [`node.appendChild()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild)
    - [`node.textContent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent)
1. Within `components/grade-table.js`, modify the definition of `GradeTable`'s `updateGrades` method to:
    - Empty the `<tbody>` of `this.tableElement`. You can find the `tbody` inside the `table` by [calling `this.tableElement`'s `querySelector` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector).
    - Loop through the `grades` parameter and for each of them:
        - Create a new `<tr>` element that looks like this (use each grade object to set the real `textContent` of each `<td>`).
          ```html
          <tr>
            <td>Name of Student</td>
            <td>Name of Course</td>
            <td>Student's Grade</td>
          </tr>
          ```
        - Append the `<tr>` element to the `<tbody>` element.
1. Verify that your application requests and renders the grades it receives from the Student Grade Table API. Your app should now look like original wireframe again, once the grades render.

## ‚úÖ Submitting Your Work

When this feature is complete, be sure to push all new commits to `origin view-all-grades`. Then open a Pull Request on your `student-grade-table` GitHub repository to merge `view-all-grades` into `master`.

Get an instructor to **Approve** your Pull Request before merging it into `master` and moving on to the next feature. **Be sure to include a screenshot or GIF of your app in the Pull Request comment.** After you get approval, merge your feature branch.
